# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree (AIND)

This repo contains my projects, code, and reports for Udacity's [AI Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/ai)


The following projects are included:

## Classic Search and AI Projects 

1. [Solve a Sudoku with AI](AIND-Sudoku/)

> Uses classic _constraint propagation_ strategies to solve Sudoku.

2. [Build a Game-Playing Agent](AIND-Isolation/)

> Uses _adversarial search agent_ to play a game called "Isolation", a deterministic, two-player game in which players alternate turns to move a piece from one to another. Implements classic **search algorithms** such as _MiniMax_, _Alpha Beta Search_, _Iterative Deepening Search_, and _Heuristic Search_ algorithms to show different plays.

3. [Implement a Planning Search](AIND-Planning-master/)

> This project implements classic **planning algorithms** often used in logistics problems. Implemented example is for an airline cargo problem. It defines _planning problem_ with initial state and the goal, uses _progression search_ to search the _state space_, and defines _heuristics_ to reach the goals. It experiments with **breadth-first search** and **depth-first search**.

4. [Build a Sign Language Recognizer](AIND-Recognizer/)

> This project implements _probabilistic models_ such as **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)** to implement a sign-language recognizer.

## Deep Learning Projects

The following projects implement deep neural networks that use computer vision to solve challenging real-world tasks, such as image classification, time series prediction, sequence modeling, and a final capstone project for facial keypoints detection.

5. [Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/laventura/AIND_dog_breed_classifier)

> This project uses **convolutional neural networks (CNN)** with _transfer learning_ from pre-trained networks (such as _VGG_, _Inception_, _ResNet_) to real world tasks such as classifying images. In this case, it is used to classify dog pictures from among ~130 dog-breeds, a task challenging enough for humans. 

6. [Time Series Prediction and Text Generation]

7. [Computer Vision Capstone Project: Facial Keypoint Detection]
